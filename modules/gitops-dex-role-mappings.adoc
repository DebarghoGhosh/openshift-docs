= Mapping users to specific roles

You can set the role of a specific user as `role:admin` on SSO through OpenShift. The user should be in a group in which the `cluster-admin` role is added. Argo CD role will not map if the user has a direct `ClusterRoleBinding` role. A quick fix is to:

. Create a group named `cluster-admins` group.
. Add the user to the group.
. Apply the cluster-admin `ClusterRole` to the group.
